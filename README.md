Contains a java program that uses the Coffee Shop Algorithm to solve queuing problems

The Coffee Shop Algorithm is an algorithm that was developed during my final year project in university of port harcourt that is based on the Queuing Systems.
The Coffee Shop Algorithm is an algorithm that can be used to determine the probability of the number of people on a queue exceeding the maximum number of people 
expected to be on the queue per time, and suggest if you need to bring in a new server to handle the people arriving at the queue.
The source code of the wesbite demonstrates this algorithm.

Thanks.
